            <p>Research Objectives: Discover what the hardest part of travel planning is and what would make it easier. </p>
            <p>Method: Conducted 5 interviews with 18-34 year olds who have at least one child (statistically this is the group that travels the most). Surveyed 10 participants who had taken at least one trip in the past year.  </p>
            <p>We found that most of our interviewees needed to spend a lot of time planning but disliked how time consuming it was, however they didn’t consider using a travel agent because they wanted to do things themselves.</p>

            <p>Participants had to look and click around for search results which was not ideal</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>I hit a roadblock after completing the initial research. I knew that users didn’t like the amount of time they spent planning trips but I didn’t really understand why. Some of the sites they were using offered ways to make the process easier. I had to call interviews back to dig deeper. My interview questions could have been more probing. </p>
            <p>There were a lot of things I learned after user testing. I assumed that if actionable options were in writing, users would read them and understand the step but just because something is written out doesn’t mean that users will know or want to read it to move to the next step. UX design is really about organizing things in a way so that users don’t need to stop and read steps, but rather they can move through a process in a way that feels natural. </p>
            <p>Although I like the final concept of a voice activated app, I’m curious how well it would work without being able to test it’s true functionality. For example, how background noise or different accents would affect its ability to understand the user or if they would really prefer to speak their choices. I would love to be able to test out a more hi-fidelity prototype. This was fun!  </p>
